abstract: |
 Autonomous navigation in unknown cluttered environments remains a challenge for vision-based unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), 
 particularly under limited onboard resources. In this paper, we present PILOT, a privileged imitation learning algorithm for 
 vision-based end-to-end UAV motion planning in cluttered, unstructured, and congested environments. A model predictive control 
 (MPC) expert with access to privileged information is introduced to generate collision-free demonstration trajectories that 
 guide the learning process of PILOT. A temporal convolutional network (TCN) is used to implicitly reconstruct all unobservable 
 privileged information by fusing sequential visual observations and historical velocity measurements. The TCN module enables a 
 UAV to achieve extended spatial awareness beyond immediate visual perception, thereby enhancing the generalization capability 
 of the learned planner. A trajectory parameterization technique is further introduced to improve motion smoothness and ensure 
 satisfaction of UAV dynamic constraints. The proposed PILOT framework is thoroughly evaluated through extensive numerical simulations 
 and diverse real-world experiments. The evaluation results demonstrate that the planner learned by PILOT achieves consistent performance 
 comparable to the MPC expert with a significant reduction computation time by more than 80% across diverse environments and different 
 UAV platforms. Ablation studies have illustrated the efficiency of both the TCN and the trajectory parameterization modules. 
 Real-world tests on a custom-built quadrotor have corroborated that the learned motion planner can generate feasible, collision-free 
 trajectories in real time directly using noisy visual observations. Both simulations and experimental results have confirmed PILOT’s 
 capability of strong generalization to previously unseen environments.
